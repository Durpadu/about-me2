                Hello User! What should I call you going forward? 
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm going to ask you some questions (name); are you ready?
            </p>

            <p>
                (name) do you think I like apples?
            </p>

            <p>
                Would you believe me if I told you that I've been to Mongolia?
            </p>

            <p> 
                I have 3 pets. Can you guess one of their names? **HINT** Two are named after food.
            </p>

            <p>
                 Have you enjoyed these questions (name)?
            </p>
