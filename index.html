                Hello User! What should I call you going forward? 
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm going to ask you some questions (name); are you ready?
            </p>

            <p>
                (name) do you like apples?
            </p>

            <p>
                Have you enjoyed these questions (name)?
            </p>

            <p>Ok (name), I've got 3 pets at home, do you think you can guess one of their name's?
                *HINT*: Two are named for foods, and the otheris derived of 'father'.
