         Hi! I'm your classate Leonard, and its nice to meet you. 

         I was born in Toledo, OH and was raised in the small town of Rossford, just south from T-Town. 
         My mom is Denise and my stepdad is Charlie, and my dad is Larry.

         After graduation in 2009, I joined the US Army. I spent some time in Iraq, and luckily never went to the 'Stan.

         I did 4 years active duty before going reserves for another 4. While off active duty I met Brittaney, who would later agree to marry me.

         We married in 2015 with Rylee my stepdaughter being the flower girl. Our son Ronan was born in 2016.

         Since being off active duty I've been an Armed Security Guard, a reatail worker, and a commercial restoration tech.
         For me, Codefellows is an opprotunity to forge a better life for my family and myself.
